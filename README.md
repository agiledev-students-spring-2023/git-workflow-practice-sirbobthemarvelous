## [Cyber Thieves Hack Phones Through Public Charging Stations](https://www.fox26houston.com/news/cyber-thieves-can-hack-cell-phones-through-public-charging-stations)
This article highlighted the one of the many unforeseen dangers in our modern lives that we don't think about. I've never really thought about public USB charging ports, even NYU's new Mercer building has them filled with spades and I've used them without a second thought.


### Forked Edit

Indeed, @sirbobthemarvelous really gives an insightful though on this topic, which closely related to our life. We should all think about this and take actions to protect us and call for further regulation. --- Comment from *Xiyu Hao (xh2187)*

### Comment from Rohan Khanderia (rk3904)
I found the article really interesting, especially because I've use public charging stations in times when I've had low battery and needed to stay out for some more time. I didn't know how much of a problem they actually are for putting your information and data at risk. It's good to know this going forward though, especially to change my way of thinking busy public areas would tend to be safer for charging my phone when out.
